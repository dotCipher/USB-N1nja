1.) avr-gcc -g -Os -mmcu=atmega8 -c flash.c

this produces an object file called flash.o which then needs to be
linked using:

2.) avr-gcc -g -mmcu=atmega8 -o flash.elf flash.o

this has now produced a binary file called flash.elf, which is
a GNU executable file. we gotta mess with it a bit more and grab
some bits out of it to make the hex file

3.) avr-objcopy -j .text -j .data -O ihex flash.elf flash.hex
